# Print all subsequences of a string
Given a string, we have to find out all subsequences of it. A String is a subsequence of a given String, that is generated by deleting some character of a given string without changing its order.

## Examples
```python
Input : abc
Output : a, b, c, ab, bc, ac, abc

Input : aaa
Output : a, aa, aaa
```

## Solution
```python
