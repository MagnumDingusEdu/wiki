# Reverse a String
Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

## Examples
```python
# Example 1:
Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]

# Example 2:
Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
```

## Constraints
* `1 <= s.length <= 105`
* `s[i] is a printable ascii character`
* `Space complexity : O(1)`
* `Time complexity: O(n)`

## Solution
```python
```
