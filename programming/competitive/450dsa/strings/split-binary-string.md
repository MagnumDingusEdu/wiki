# Split the binary string into substrings with equal number of 0s and 1s
Given a binary string `str` of length `N`, the task is to find the maximum count of substrings `str` can be divided into such that all the substrings are balanced i.e. they have equal number of `0s` and `1s`. If it is not possible to split str satisfying the conditions then print `-1`.

## Examples
```cpp
Input: str = “0100110101”
Output: 4
# The required substrings are “01”, “0011”, “01” and “01”.

Input: str = “0111100010”
Output: 3
```

## Constraints
* `Time complexity : O(n)`
* `Space complexity : O(1)`

## Solution
```python
```
