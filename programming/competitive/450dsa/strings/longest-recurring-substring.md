# Longest Repeating Subsequence 
Given a string `str`, find length of the longest repeating subseequence such that the two subsequence don’t have same string character at same position, i.e., any `i’th` character in the two subsequences shouldn’t have the same index in the original string.

## Examples
```python
Input: str = "axxxy"
Output: 2
# Explanation: The longest repeating subsequenece is "xx".
```

```python
Input: str = "aab"
output: 1
# Explanation: The longest reapting subsequenece is "a".
```

## Constraints
* `Expected Time Complexity: O(n2)`
* `Expected Space Complexity: O(n2)`
* `1 <= |str| <= 500`

## Solution
```python
```
