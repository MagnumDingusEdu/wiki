# Longest Palindrome in a String
Given a string S, find the longest palindromic substring in S. Substring of string `S: S[ i . . . . j ]` where `0 ≤ i ≤ j < len(S)`. 
Palindrome string: A string which reads the same backwards. More formally, `S` is palindrome if `reverse(S) = S`. Incase of conflict, return the substring which occurs first ( with the least starting index).

## Examples
```python
Input:
S = "aaaabbaa"
Output: 'aabbaa'
# Explanation: The longest Palindromic
# substring is "aabbaa".
```
```python
Input: 
S = "abc"
Output: a
# Explanation: "a", "b" and "c" are the 
# longest palindromes with same length.
# The result is the one with the least
# starting index.
```

## Constraints
* `Expected Time Complexity: O(|S|^2).`
* `Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).`
* `1 ≤ |S| ≤ 10^3`

## Solution
```python
