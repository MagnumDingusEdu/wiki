# Median in a row-wise sorted Matrix 
Given a row wise sorted matrix of size RxC where R and C are always odd, find the median of the matrix.

## Examples

```cpp
Input:
R = 3, C = 3
M = [[1, 3, 5], 
     [2, 6, 9], 
     [3, 6, 9]]

Output: 5

```
```cpp
Input:
R = 3, C = 1
M = [[1], [2], [3]]
Output: 2
```

## Constraints


```cpp
1<= R,C <=150
1<= matrix[i][j] <=2000
```

## Solution
```python
```
