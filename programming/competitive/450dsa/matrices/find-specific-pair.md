# Find a specific pair in Matrix
Given an n x n matrix mat[n][n] of integers, find the maximum value of mat(c, d) â€“ mat(a, b) over all choices of indexes such that both c > a and d > b.

## Examples
```cpp
mat[N][N] = [[ 1, 2, -1, -4, -20 ],
             [ -8, -3, 4, 2, 1 ], 
             [ 3, 8, 6, 1, 3 ],
             [ -4, -1, 1, 7, -6 ],
             [ 0, -4, 10, -5, 1 ]];
Output: 18
// The maximum value is 18 as mat[4][2] 
// - mat[1][0] = 18 has maximum difference. 
```

## Constraints
Expected time complexity : `O(n^2)`

## Solution
```python
```
