# Search an element in a matrix
Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an m x n matrix. This matrix has the following properties:

* Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
* The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

## Examples
![mat.jpg](/mat.jpg)
```cpp
Input: 

	matrix = [[ 1, 3, 5, 7],
  					[10,11,16,20],
  					[23,30,34,60]]
	target = 3
  
Output: true

```
```cpp
Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],
                [10,11,16,20],
                [23,30,34,60]]
                target = 13
Output: false
```

## Constraints


```cpp
m == matrix.length
n == matrix[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 100
-104 <= matrix[i][j], target <= 104
```

## Solution
```python
```
