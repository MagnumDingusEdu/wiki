# Row with max 1s 
Given a boolean 2D array of n x m dimensions where each row is sorted. Find the 0-based index of the first row that has the maximum number of 1's.

## Examples

```cpp
Input: 
N = 4 , M = 4
Arr[][] = {{0, 1, 1, 1},
           {0, 0, 1, 1},
           {1, 1, 1, 1},
           {0, 0, 0, 0}}
Output: 2
```
```cpp
Input: 
N = 2, M = 2
Arr[][] = {{0, 0}, {1, 1}}
Output: 1
```

## Constraints


```cpp
Expected Time Complexity: O(N+M)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

1 ≤ N, M ≤ 103
0 ≤ Arr[i][j] ≤ 1 
```

## Solution
```python
```
