# Row with max 1s 
Given a boolean 2D array of n x m dimensions where each row is sorted. Find the 0-based index of the first row that has the maximum number of 1's.

## Examples
```cpp
Input: 
N = 4 , M = 4
Arr[][] = {{0, 1, 1, 1},
           {0, 0, 1, 1},
           {1, 1, 1, 1},
           {0, 0, 0, 0}}
Output: 2
```
```cpp
Input: 
N = 2, M = 2
Arr[][] = {{0, 0}, {1, 1}}
Output: 1
```
