# Common elements in all rows of a given matrix
Given an m x n matrix, find all common elements present in all rows in O(mn) time and one traversal of matrix.

## Examples
```cpp
Input:
mat[4][5] = {{1, 2, 1, 4, 8},
             {3, 7, 8, 5, 1},
             {8, 7, 7, 3, 1},
             {8, 1, 2, 7, 9},
            };

Output: 
1 8 or 8 1
// 8 and 1 are present in all rows.
```

## Solution 
```python
```
